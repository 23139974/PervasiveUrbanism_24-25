    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "Python is a high-level language developed by Guido van Rossum in the 1980s. \n",
    "It is a modern language that is easy to read, resulting in an easy learning curve.  That has contributed to Python's popularity. Many datascience libaries are written in Python and it's the \"bread-and-butter\" language fo ML applications. Many applications such as Blender or Rhino allow you to script in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "There are a few different options for installing Python. First, choose the version; \n",
    "second, choose the programming environment. We'll use Python version **3.x** as opposed to 2.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Environments\n",
    "This comes in many options: \n",
    "- We can use the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that ships with Python. This is very basic, but the interface is not overwhelming (a good thing when you start)\n",
    "- You can run python from the browser in [google collab](https://colab.research.google.com/) - here you don't need to install anything. This ia a very beginner friendly, you just need an account and an internet connection. \n",
    "- I will be using [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), mostly because I am used to it. There are other environments like PyCharm or conda , etc., and you are free to use them. Follow this [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) if you want to use python with VS code. \n",
    "For simplicity, we will be using a format called *\"Jupyter Notebook\"* - that works well for teaching. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation on Windows\n",
    "1. Go to the Python webpage and download the latest version.\n",
    "2. During installation, ensure the installer adds a PATH variable by checking the box, then continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation on Mac\n",
    "The installation process is similar but does not ask for the PATH variable. Simply click through the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Interactive Shell\n",
    "The first examples will be done in the *terminal*. Alternativly, you can run them in this notebook as well. \n",
    "Python runs in an interactive shell, where commands are typed and evaluated in real-time. \n",
    "This is different from compiled languages like Arduino (C) or Processing (Java).\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language that runs on the back of an interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Languages](images/Languages.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the terminal by typing `cmd` into the windows seach bar. Once the terminal is up and running, type `python` to start the interactive enviroment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![CMD](images/CMD.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables and Data Types\n",
    "Variables and Data Types (Integer, Floating Point, Strings, simple array)\n",
    "Unlike Arduino (c language) or processing (java), Python does not need to know the type of the variable, a declaration like this is is correct:"

Python is actually a specification for a language that can be implemented in many different ways. The different implementations may be for compatibility with other libraries or frameworks such as .NET. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pure Python libraries should work regardless of your Python implementation. Rhino 7 works with IronPython and that means that libraries built on C (like NumPy) won’t work. This section provides a quick rundown on the most popular implementations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CPython : CPython is the reference implementation of Python, written in C. It compiles Python code to intermediate bytecode which is then interpreted by a virtual machine. CPython provides the highest level of compatibility with Python packages and C extension modules.\n",
    "- Jython: Jython is a Python interpreter implementation that compiles Python code to Java bytecode which is then executed by the JVM. If you use processing in python, it runs on jython. \n",
    "- IronPython: IronPython is the python that rhino uses. It comes in python 2.7. Rhino 8 however seems to run CPython code\n",
    "- MicroPython: MicoPython is for microcontrollers, similar to arduino. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that not all the third party libraries that work under  CPython also work under the IronPython implementation of Rhino 7. So you can not import Numpy and Scipy directly into grasshopper, you will need to take detours (https://wiki.mcneel.com/grasshopper/cpython)\n"
