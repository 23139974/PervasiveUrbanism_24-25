53743636714,65535,5c6e4630ee,Canary Wharf,london jelltex jelltecks,565,"Time to go home.

Sadly.

The four days have flown by and we have seen most types of weather with the exception of blizzard and tornado.

I have been bitten to buggary by mozzies and midges, so sleep was difficult and fitful. 

But come seven, I felt not too bad. We went down for breakfast at half past: more sausage and bacon butties for me. Then back upstairs to pack.

No checking out to be done, so at half nine, we went out to load the car, with a plan to drive of the Mountains of Ox on the way to Knock to catch the flight.

I decided to try to buy a bottle of whiskey, so we drove round trying to find the entrance to Tesco's car park, and then another ten minutes trying to find a space.

And then once inside I found it was laid out like Ikea: you'll never leave, and then in the booze section, none could be bought by law until half ten.

Bugger.

We headed out of Sligo for the last time and came to Ballysadare where we stopped to snap the falls, and then go to the Sava Center so i could by some whiskey, it was now after half ten.

It was then that we realised we had to high tail it to the airport as time was getting on, so no mountains of Ox for me.

As is typical, the sun came out and the drive back was wonderful, dropping the car off was simple as the only guy on duty told us to leave the key and he'd sort things when he got back.

A short walk to the terminal, and a half hour wait to drop the bags off, through security where we could meet back up with Ian while we waited for the flight to be called.

And this time it was full. No spare seats to be had. We squeezed in and waited to roll back.

And that was that, holibobs over with.

An uneventful flight, stacked over north west London, then a low pass along the Thames and down, and so back to crowded, busy England.

Once we were off the plane, there was no immigration, so straight to baggage reclaim, then off to the car park having already called, so we only had a five minute wait for the trusty steed to be brought up.

All we had to do then was get round the M25, drop Ian off in Waterningbury and then home.

Simples.

At the height of the evening rush hour.

It was mad, and hot, and tok nearly two hours to get to the M26 and the turn off for Ian's.

Ten to six we arrived, and Anna was waiting as was their canine welcoming committee.

We say goodbye and take our leave, round the edge of Maidstone to the Motorway and home, by way of M&amp;S where we bought some mozzarella for Caprese.

And then home.

Cats could not give a fuck that we were back.

Well, Mulder did when he saw Jools.

Meowmeaowmeaow

We unpack, Jools puts the first lot of washing on and I make dinner.

Phew. ",2024-05-23 14:40:40,51.510647,0.007086,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53743636714_5c6e4630ee_m.jpg,Jelltex,16105638@N00,photo

50915551763,65535,dd90e650f6,Canning Town Change Pit,trams london ia industrialarcheaology,1745,"London trams employed conduit current collection - but only in inner London. In outer London conventional overhead wiring was used. This meant that on routes that crossed the border cars had to change between the two systems. This was done at 'change pits'. Here special staff would extract or fit the 'plough' whilst the conductor would lower or raise the trolley pole according to direction. This pit at Canning Town had become disused following the introduction of trolleybuses in about 1939. In May 1981 you could see rails, the conduit - and a scar in the cobbles where the pit for the ploughs had been filled in.  
Despite this being private property I had clearly climbed over the wall! This would have been on a Sunday, so there would have been nobody to stop me. 
Its all gone now.      ",1981-05-01 00:00:00,51.513176,0.000772,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50915551763_dd90e650f6_m.jpg,DaveAFlett,9003948@N05,photo

I am looking at this huge development with some wariness since it is right in the middle of one of the smaller arty nexuses of London, centering around Trinity Buoy Wharf.  Yeah I know, we are desperate for homes in London - and this development doesn't seem to have sparked anywhere near the fuss and rage of Hackney Wick - but it is all too easy to see this place following a similar pattern.  Another potential invasion of one of the fascinating parts of London's psychogeography - like Camden Market, like the Wick, like so many.  We'll just have to see!

The O2 Arena is in the background ... only between it and Goodluck Hope is the old Thames itself, invisible from here.  ",2020-06-03 00:13:29,51.510171,0.006136,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49965623722_dcda232b2e_m.jpg,eibonvale,23366204@N05,photo

It is a 1929 Durant Six Sixty 4 door Sedan.  Manufactured in Oakland USA and originally supplied by Division Street Garage. New Jersey. It was  exported to England in 1995 where it had a ground up restoration including all of the interior finished in blue and black with wood spoke wheels and blue cloth interior.
The engine and gearbox have been replaced with a Ford 2 litre Pinto engine and automatic gearbox. The engine was changed to make the car more user friendly for  running a vintage wedding car hire business. Info from ebay sales ad.

History of route 69,sn12avz dn33783 towertransit alexanderdennis adl adlenviro400 adle40d enviro400 enviro40d e400 e40d bus transport tfl transportforlondon publictransport londonbus londontransport londonbuses,5624,"The first use of route number 69 was in 1952 when it was used for a route that replaced tram 54. This route ran from Victoria to Grove Park and was renumbered route 36B in 1958.

The number was not redundant for long and this version of route 69 was created in 1960 to replace trolleybus route 669. The initial routeing was from North Woolwich Free Ferry to Chingford Mount via Stratford, Leyton and Walthamstow. On Sundays buses only ran from Stratford to North Woolwich until 1968 when that day’s service was extended to match the rest of the week. At the same time the route was extended to Chingford Station.

It was withdrawn from Walthamstow to Chingford on weekdays between 1973 and 1976, replaced by route 269, but returned to the status quo thereafter. 1981 saw the route cut back to Chingford Mount, as it had started, but it was extended back to Chingford Station on Sundays in 1985 and then all days in 1987. Making it look like the decision makers kept changing their minds, it was changed again in 1988, this time being withdrawn entirely between Walthamstow Central and Chingford.

The next change was in 1999 when it was diverted from Connaught Bridge to London City Airport. New route 474 took over the working to North Woolwich. The section from Canning Town to London City Airport was withdrawn in 2005 bring the route to where it is today.

It has run from a few garages in its history, and in February it moved from West Ham (WH) to Lea Interchange (LI) as Tower Transit won the contract from Stagecoach. In this photo DN33783 is seen arriving at Canning Town. This bus was previously based at Westbourne Park Garage for route 23, a central London route that has unusually inherited older Volvo B7TL’s as a side effect of this tender win.

It also marked the opening of a new garage at River Road in Barking - the route is currently the only one working from it but it is expected that others will soon follow. The garage is almost on the line of route for routes EL1 and EL2 so these appear to be safe bets to transfer from Rainham.

It is being operated by a batch of Enviro 400's that have been displaced twice by New Routemaster conversions. E166 started off on route 453 at Mandela Way and then shifted to route 68 at Camberwell. It has a quick stint at Docklands Buses from 03/05/16 until the start of this route.
